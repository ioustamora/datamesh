## üîç **REALITY CHECK: What's Actually Working**

### **‚úÖ PRODUCTION-READY COMPONENTS**
1. **Traditional CLI Mode**: All 47 commands work perfectly
2. **REST API Server**: Full-featured with authentication and swagger docs
3. **Web Interface**: Complete modern frontend with all features
4. **File Storage**: Enterprise-grade with encryption and redundancy
5. **Network Layer**: Robust P2P networking with health monitoring
6. **Monitoring System**: ML-powered analytics and alerting
7. **Governance**: Complete democratic governance and economics
8. **Testing**: Comprehensive cluster testing suite

### **üü° PARTIALLY WORKING**
1. **Actor System**: Basic commands work, advanced integration incomplete
2. **Interactive/Service Modes**: Limited command parsing in actor mode
3. **Command Integration**: Traditional mode complete, actor mode basic

### **‚ùå DOCUMENTATION vs REALITY GAPS**
1. **Actor System Claims**: Documented as "complete" but actually basic
2. **Command Coverage**: Traditional mode has all commands, actor mode limited
3. **Production Readiness**: Core system is production-ready, actor enhancement incomplete
