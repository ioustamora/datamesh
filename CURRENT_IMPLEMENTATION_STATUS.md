## 🎯 Critical Implementation Gaps

### **Priority 1: Actor System Command Integration**
**Impact**: Most commands fail in actor mode
- Network commands not integrated with actor system
- Advanced commands return "not implemented" errors
- Interactive/service modes lack command parsing

### **Priority 2: Advanced Feature Implementation**
**Impact**: Many advertised features non-functional
- Advanced commands are placeholders
- System components have mock implementations
- API server endpoints incomplete

### **Priority 3: Mode Implementations**
**Impact**: Limited deployment options
- Interactive mode lacks command parsing
- Service mode has no real functionality
- Missing production deployment features
