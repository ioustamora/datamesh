# DataMesh Security Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### üîê **Critical Security Requirements (MUST DO)**

- [ ] **JWT Secret Configuration**
  - [ ] Generate cryptographically secure JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
  - [ ] Store JWT secret in environment variable `DATAMESH_JWT_SECRET`
  - [ ] Never commit JWT secret to version control
  - [ ] Verify JWT secret strength: `openssl rand -base64 32`

- [ ] **TLS/HTTPS Configuration**
  - [ ] Obtain valid TLS certificates from trusted CA (not self-signed for production)
  - [ ] Configure certificate paths in `DATAMESH_TLS_CERT_PATH` and `DATAMESH_TLS_KEY_PATH`
  - [ ] Set `DATAMESH_ENABLE_HTTPS=true`
  - [ ] Verify TLS configuration: `openssl s_client -connect your-domain:8443`

- [ ] **Database Security**
  - [ ] Generate database encryption key: `openssl rand -hex 32`
  - [ ] Set `DATAMESH_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable
  - [ ] Enable data encryption at rest: `enable_data_encryption_at_rest = true`

- [ ] **Access Control**
  - [ ] Create dedicated `datamesh` user account
  - [ ] Set proper file permissions (600 for secrets, 750 for directories)
  - [ ] Disable root access for DataMesh processes
  - [ ] Configure firewall rules (ports 8443, 4001)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Security Configuration**

- [ ] **API Security Headers**
  - [ ] Verify HSTS header is enabled: `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - [ ] Check CSP header: `Content-Security-Policy`
  - [ ] Confirm X-Frame-Options: `DENY`
  - [ ] Verify X-Content-Type-Options: `nosniff`

- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**
  - [ ] Set JWT expiry to 8 hours or less for production
  - [ ] Enable email verification: `DATAMESH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true`
  - [ ] Configure rate limiting: `DATAMESH_ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true`
  - [ ] Review CORS settings for production domains

- [ ] **Key Management**
  - [ ] Enable automatic key rotation: `DATAMESH_AUTO_KEY_ROTATION=true`
  - [ ] Set rotation interval: `DATAMESH_KEY_ROTATION_INTERVAL_HOURS=24`
  - [ ] Secure key storage directory permissions (700)
  - [ ] Backup encryption keys securely

- [ ] **P2P Network Security**
  - [ ] Configure trusted peer list in `/etc/datamesh/security/trusted_peers.json`
  - [ ] Enable peer authentication: `require_peer_authentication = true`
  - [ ] Set connection limits: `max_connections_per_peer = 5`
  - [ ] Review bootstrap peer configuration

### üìä **Monitoring & Logging**

- [ ] **Security Monitoring**
  - [ ] Enable audit logging: `DATAMESH_ENABLE_AUDIT_LOG=true`
  - [ ] Configure log retention: minimum 365 days for compliance
  - [ ] Set up log rotation with logrotate
  - [ ] Monitor failed authentication attempts

- [ ] **System Monitoring**
  - [ ] Configure health checks at `/api/v1/health`
  - [ ] Set up metrics endpoint monitoring (port 9090)
  - [ ] Monitor disk usage for log and data directories
  - [ ] Set up alerting for critical security events

- [ ] **Log Analysis**
  - [ ] Monitor for unusual API access patterns
  - [ ] Track key rotation events
  - [ ] Alert on certificate expiration (30 days before)
  - [ ] Monitor P2P connection anomalies

### üîÑ **Operational Security**

- [ ] **Regular Maintenance**
  - [ ] Schedule monthly security reviews
  - [ ] Plan quarterly certificate rotation
  - [ ] Update DataMesh software regularly
  - [ ] Patch operating system monthly

- [ ] **Backup & Recovery**
  - [ ] Backup encryption keys to secure offline storage
  - [ ] Test key recovery procedures
  - [ ] Backup configuration files
  - [ ] Document disaster recovery procedures

- [ ] **Incident Response**
  - [ ] Prepare incident response playbook
  - [ ] Configure emergency key rotation procedures
  - [ ] Set up security contact information
  - [ ] Plan for compromised node isolation

## Environment-Specific Checklists

### Production Environment

- [ ] Use CA-issued TLS certificates (no self-signed)
- [ ] Disable Swagger UI: `enable_swagger = false`
- [ ] Set strict CORS policy for known frontend domains
- [ ] Enable all security headers
- [ ] Use strong JWT expiry (‚â§ 8 hours)
- [ ] Enable comprehensive logging
- [ ] Set up external monitoring
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Staging Environment

- [ ] Use valid TLS certificates or trusted self-signed
- [ ] Enable most security features
- [ ] Longer JWT expiry acceptable (‚â§ 24 hours)
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Test all security features
- [ ] Validate certificate renewal processes

### Development Environment

- [ ] Use development configuration template
- [ ] Self-signed certificates acceptable
- [ ] Longer JWT expiry for convenience (‚â§ 24 hours)
- [ ] Enable Swagger UI for API testing
- [ ] Relaxed CORS policy for localhost
- [ ] Debug logging enabled

## Security Verification Commands

### Test JWT Configuration
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" \
  https://your-domain:8443/api/v1/files
# Should return 401 Unauthorized
```

### Test TLS Configuration
```bash
openssl s_client -connect your-domain:8443 -tls1_3
# Should connect with TLS 1.3
```

### Test Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain:8443/api/v1/health
# Should include security headers
```

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
for i in {1..1010}; do
  curl https://your-domain:8443/api/v1/health >/dev/null 2>&1
done
# Should start returning 429 after rate limit exceeded
```

### Verify File Permissions
```bash
ls -la /etc/datamesh/.env
# Should show -rw------- datamesh datamesh

ls -la /var/lib/datamesh/keys/
# Should show drwx------ datamesh datamesh
```
